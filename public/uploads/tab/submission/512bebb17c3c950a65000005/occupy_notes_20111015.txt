Please forgive the egregious use of commas for unordered lists.

- POP: Boston GA discussed quorum for 1/2 hour last night
- Hand signals were explained.
- Ben -> food committee -> 20 pizzas @ 6:30PM
- Recap of decisions made at last two GAs
- Breakout into groups* of 10-15 people (each group had facilitator, notetaker, spokesperson)
* Groups were asked to come up with two goals that they would like to see Occupy Worcester address, and then one tactic to help facilitate those goals (length: 30 mins [actually took closer to 45])l.
- POP: There was concern that consensus for us was different than Boston (75% with no blocks). Facilitators noted that it is the same.
- POP: Didn't we do these goals in the first general assembly? Response: No, we weren't asked to come up with concrete goals/tactics.
- POI: People who had spoken with Wall St/Boston would like us to organize our own effort in Worcester, rather than providing logistical support.
- POI: People had also heard that Boston would like logistical support.
- POP: Soapboxing will come later.

Reportback from breakout groups
-----------------------------------------------
Group 1)
- Goal: Start Worcester encampment. From there, personal goals can be addressed. From occupation, we can ask college students to join us, and recruit a more diverse crowd.
- Goal: Equal Opportunity for the 99%.
- Tactic(s): To this end, we could boycott banks, create an alternate economy, support local businesses/urban farms, barter, appeal for higher taxes for corporations, lead more peaceful protests, and gather more people.

Group 2)
- Goal: Awareness
- Tactics: Occupy physically; public demonstration to generate support.
- Goal: Broad, clear message as movement (e.g. protests in the 60s to end the war). Peaceful; non-violent; broad; incorporated.

Group 3)
- Goal(s): Increase awareness; political transparency; identify with deep green resistance (in conjunction with end of nuclear power/weapons)
- Tactic(s): Roaming occupation and headquarters to prevent media apathy/promote awareness.

Group 4)

- Goal: Create a tangible mission that is pertinent to Worcester.
- Tactic(s): Create permanent, comfortable space for meetings to increase direct action; public hearing sit-ins; marches; provide support for November 5th Bank Transfer Day.

Group 5)
- Goal(s): Diversity; reaching out to different groups in the community
- Tactic: Outreach specific to certain groups in the community; people who have access to these groups should provide outreach and invite people from those groups to Occupy Worcester.
- Goal: Confront power with non-violence
- Tactic(s): Create headquarters; patronize and work from a small business (this could, as a side effect, attract more business to the particular establishment chosen); create banners/posters.

Group 9)
- Goal: Get corporations out of politics
- Tactic(s): Seek reversal of Citizens U decision; seek ammendment; abolish corporate personhood; campaign finance reform
- Goal: Address income disparity; use language that doesn't suggest socialism/the end of capitalism, as these terms are overloaded symbols, and are too open to interpretation.
- Tactic: Direct consumer action to hurt corporations/banks.
- Idea: The Glass-Steagall act was mentioned [my note: not sure in what regard, or whether this referred to the first or second act. Someone can explain this better than I can].

-----------------------------------------------
- Spokespeople from groups wrote out list of goals
- Goals were read out to GA. No blocks were made.

Report on second breakout group
-----------------------------------------------
Group 1) not present

Group 2) not present

Group 3)
- Recommended permanent headquarters with direct action committee (emphasis on this headquarters being legal)

Group 4)
- Find indoor space for headquarters that is free or within the financial means of the movement.
- Each day, direct action (e.g. at City Hall, Union Station, Bank of America).
- Maintain mission of overall Occupy movements.

Group 5)

- Roaming occupation
- Go door-to-door in neighborhoods before actions, letting members of that community know what the action will be about, and encouraging community members to be a part of the action.

Group 6)
- Find a warm place from which to work, and from which the group can stay a while (i.e. long-term); organize mobile efforts as a group.

Group 7)
- Anyone who wants to occupy physically should occupy (whenever and wherever).

Group 8 (aka Team Cowabunga)
- Diverse action; Headquarters more important; focus on long-term goals.
- Sequence: community outreach, then direct action
- Get word out, more people involved.

Group 9)
- Some form of occupation (not enthused about prospect of cold weather); create a permanent focus of the movement, so as to not lose momentum.
- Some form of office.
- Work with community groups, especially.

Group 10)
- Outreach for diversity
- Focus on 'Positive Creative Action'. 
- Create headquarters with mobile units.
- No physical occupation (too cold, not enough people).

Group 11)
- Physical occupation
- One or more members from the group will autonomously set up tents with or without consensus from the group (starting Sunday, October 16 @ 6PM).

Group 12)
- Have meetings at the Worcester Public Library every day
- Continuous action to keep the movement in the public consciousness.
-----------------------------------------------

** Proposal: People who want to occupy can occupy; people who want to create a headquarters can work towards creating a headquarters (these things are not mutually exclusive).

- Blocking concern: Occupying public spaces without a permit could reflect negatively on the Occupy Worcester group as a whole, regardless of whether the rest of the group is on board with physical occupation.

- POI: Autonomous action does not reflect group; we have a right to be here.

- POI: Police tore down Sukkah at Occupy Seattle. Let cops be seen negatively. We organize peacefully; their violence looks bad.

- POI: The establishment of a headquarters should not necessarily mean that the headquarters would provide logistical support for encampment. In this proposal, these two things should be distinct.

- POI: People who have spoken to people from Occupy Boston have heard that people from Occupy Boston will come to Worcester in order to support physical occupation (i.e. physically occupying with the group).

- POP: Let's split the two proposals.

- CQ: How are headquarters and occupation separate? Response unclear.

- POP: Let's deal with the second proposal first.

- Consensus reached on proposal to create an indoor headquarters. Logistics are to be determined either at the next logistics team meeting or at the next GA.

- CQ: How does headquarters increase visibility?
- Response: We can put a banner up outside headquarters.
- Response: Outreach.

- POI: Headquarters does not restrict actions to being indoors. We can still do outside action.

- Soapboxing for 1st proposal: if we don't occupy, we'll stagnate. Occupying physically will gain sympathy, people.

- POI/Soapboxing: We should have headquarters first. A direct action group can then facilitate encampment.

- CQ: How can a direct action body at a headquarters we don't have decide if/where encampment will occur (someone yelled that we'll have to act quickly).

- CQ/Ammendment: Let's remove headquarters provision from proposal 2. Encampment doesn't need headquarters.
- Response (loosely, not consensed upon): OK.

- Blocking concern: Headquarters should not decide on encampment.

- Concern/Soapboxing: Feds trump state law. If cops attempt to kick us out, it is not constitutional. Federal law trumps city ordinance.

- POP: Move back to proposals.

** Temperature check: do we support individual occupiers (i.e. people who decide to physically occupy, independent of the group)?
- Temperature check indicates that we do [this was later called into question].

** Proposal: Can we agree that we will support physical occupation in general (time and place to be determined)?

- POI: Agreeing to support physical occupation does not mean that you have to physically occupy yourself.

- Consensus reached on supporting physical occupation (time and place to be determined).

- CQ: Was the vote on solidarity with individual occupiers a temperature check or were we seeking consensus
- Response unclear [notes are clear: it was about seeking consensus].

- POI/Soapboxing: People will be here at 6PM regardless. Speaker will be one, and asks for support. People pursuing individual occupation are frustrated with the slow decision-making process. Please offer solidarity.

- CQ: What went through (i.e. on which items did we reach consensus)?
- Response from facilitators: 1) People will seek to establish a headquarters. 2) Physical occupation will occur at some time and some place.

- POI: Violating rules in public parks can result in fines of up to (and no more than) $200. People choosing to occupy without a permit should be aware of this.

** Proposal: Our next GA should be Tuesday, October 18 @ 5:30PM, to overlap with the city council meeting at 7PM.

** Counter-Proposal: Tomorrow (Sunday), October 16 @ 6PM to coincide with individual occupation efforts.

** Ammended Proposal: Should we do both?

- Consensus reached for having GAs on both 10/16 @ 6PM and 10/18 @ 5:30PM.

- POI: Facilitator training is available to interested parties tomorrow at the Pleasant Street Neighborhood Network Center (301 Pleasant St). Anne will lead training.

Many things were tabled for the next GA (e.g. group solidarity with individual occupiers, whether or not headquarters will facilitate occupation efforts).
