F                                C              Bb
When you were young you were the king of carrot flowers
F                         C            Bb
And how you built a tower tumbling through the trees
C                         Bb               F   Bb F C Bb
In holy rattlesnakes that fell around your feet

F                                      C           Bb
And your mom would stick a fork right into daddy's shoulder
F                               C              Bb
And dad would throw the garbage all across the floor
C                              Bb                  F        Bb F C Bb
As we would lay and learn what each other's bodies were for

F                             C                    Bb
And this is the room one afternoon I knew I could love you
F                        C              Bb
And from above you how I sank into your soul
C                            Bb           F     Bb F C Bb
Into that secret place where no one dares to go

F                             C             Bb
And mom would drink until she was no longer speaking
F                              C                 Bb
And dad would dream of all the different ways to die
C                           Bb            F     Bb F C Bb
Each one a little more than he could dare to try
